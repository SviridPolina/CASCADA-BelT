    A (bit-vector) property pair, or simply a property, over a function :math:`f`

    Note that arithmetic with properties is not supported.
    For example, two `Property` objects ``d1`` and ``d2``
    cannot be XORed, i.e., ``d1 ^ d2``.
    This can be done instead by performing the arithmetic with
    the property values and converting the resulting
    `Term` to a property, that is, ``Property(d1.val ^ d2.val)``

        Given a function :math:`y = f(x)`,
        an input property :math:`p_x` propagates (over :math:`f`) to
        an output property :math:`p_y` if the propagation probability
        :math:`PP_f(\\alpha, \\beta)` is not zero.

        Note that if :math:`f` has :math:`t` operands,
        the input property is actually a list of :math:`t` properties, that is,
        :math:`p_x = (p_{x_0}, p_{x_1}, \dots, p_{x_{t-1}})`,
        and similar for :math:`p_y`.

        For some functions, any input property propagates to a unique
        output property with probability 1, and the output property
        can be easily computed from the input property.

        Examples of probability-one propagations are the following:

        * For the `Value` property type, for any operation :math:`f` and any
          input property :math:`p_x`, the output property :math:`p_y`
          is uniquely determined and its bit-vector value is ``f(p_x.val)``.
        * For the `Difference` property type with difference operation :math:`-`
          (e.g., XOR),  for any linear (over :math:`-`) operation :math:`f` and any
          input property :math:`p_x`, the output property :math:`p_y`
          is uniquely determined and its bit-vector value is ``f(p_x.val)``.
        * For the `LinearMask` property, for any XOR-linear operation :math:`f`
          and any input property :math:`p_x`,
          the output property :math:`p_y` is uniquely determined and its
          bit-vector value satisfies ``p_x.val == M(p_y.val)``, where :math:`M`
          is the transpose of the binary matrix representing :math:`f`.

        If for the given `Operation` ``op`` any input property propagates
        to a unique output property with probability 1 and the output property
        can be easily computed from the input property, this method
        returns the corresponding output property (for the given
        input property ``input_prop``) as a `Property` object.
        Otherwise, this method returns the
        `abstractproperty.opmodel.OpModel` of the operation ``op``
        with the given input property ``input_prop``.

        .. note::
            Operations ``op`` with scalar operands are not supported,
            but these operands can be removed with `make_partial_operation`
            and partial operations are supported by this method.
